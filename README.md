### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Use layout techniques with width, min-width, max-width, vh and vw.
- Understand and apply Image Optimization techniques such as min-width, max-width, retina display, etc.
- Identify breakpoints and apply media queries to adjust layout.
- Understand the difference between mobile-up and desktop-down CSS.
- Effectively use media queries to adjust and adapt your page layouts.
- Understand how media queries work in the cascade.
- Understand that Responsive Design is dictated by visual break points and not device sizes.

```
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
    CSS-Code;
}
```


By default, all p tags will have red text â€“ unless they have the class blue_text, in which case the text will be blue. We can do a similar thing with media queries.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

Now all p tags will be red until the screen size reaches 600px, when they'll turn blue. How do we determine the pixel width to use in the media query?

### Breakpoints

The best approach to identifying the size of a media query is to test your site for breakpoints. A breakpoint is simply a specific browser width where the layout either breaks or no longer follows the intended design. Another way to think about it: The design looks 'off' or just plain bad!

You can use Chrome Dev Tools to measure the width of a page open in the browser. Adjust the width of the browser and identify breakpoints. If you see an unintended or unacceptable change in design/layout, your media query should be set to the width of the browser when the change occurs. These numbers will not typically be 'nice' or even something like `1050px`, but more likely seem random (like `527px`).

What else do we need to get started?

### The Viewport Meta Tag!
We've seen some problems that can happen if we don't override some of the initial properties of a website. One of the properties we need to override is the viewport. A viewport is the <b>user's visible area</b> of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
> The ```width=device-width``` key-value pair sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device. The ```initial-scale=1``` key-value pair sets the initial zoom level when visiting the page.

This ensures that the viewport is the same as the screen, and displays at a natural zoom of 100%.

## Class Work: Responsive Design 

### Color Scheme
- General font-size `14px`
- Album cover background `#401935`
- footer `#1B0B17`
- text paragraph `#873672`
- header tags `font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;`


Consider this [HTML](lab1/index.html) and [CSS](lab1/css/main.css), which renders like this on a large screen:
![albums-1](assets/albums-1.png)



All content on the page is aligned in a single column, whether viewed on a small or large screen width. Now we need to specify **at which width** we want these styles to be applied. We can do this by adding in media queries to our 

Here are the four different layouts as we reduce the screen size:
![albums-1](assets/albums-1.png)
![albums-3-med](assets/albums-3-med.png)
![albums-3-sm](assets/albums-3-sm.png)
![albums-3-xs](assets/albums-3-xs.png)

Now our layout looks great on all screen sizes! The final touch is to adjust the copy on the page. Here's the final look and how it renders on a small screen:
![albums-4](assets/albums-4.png)

You can access all of the code [here](codealong/albums).

## Independent Practice: Dream Team 
Take a look at the following mockup. 

Choose a Dream Team of 3-4 fellow students and work together to wireframe out what the site should look like when it's responsive.

Start by wireframing a mobile version of the site. If you have time, wireframe a tablet version of the site.

As you wireframe, it may be helpful to consider the following questions:

1. Is there any content that might not be necessary to display on smaller devices?
2. What content needs to be visible?
	- For example, is it necessary to show the entire nav if there are other ways of getting to navigation? 
3. Identify any extra styling.
	- Can we simplify some of the styles a bit for smaller devices, while still maintaining the same look and feel for the site?

Have each group present their wireframes and describe why they made the choices they did.
